<h1>Sal's Portfolio</h1>

Hello! Welcome to my github for my portfolio, for this weeks Challenge I decided I 
decided I wanted to get as close to the mock up provided while still adding my own
style to it. I plan to revamp it entirely in the future so It better reflects my
knowledge of HTML/CSS as I go through this course.

Below are the links to the Website and the Github repository:<br>
